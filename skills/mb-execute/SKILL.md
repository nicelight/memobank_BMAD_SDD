# mb-execute - Implementation Handoff

## Purpose
`mb-execute` implements one scoped JSON task. It is not a mini-scheduler and it
does not own task closure. Flow: read task -> minimal preflight -> protocol ->
implement -> local gates -> evidence -> handoff.

## Status Transition Modes

Status transitions have two modes.

Scheduler mode:
- `/autopilot` and `/autonomous` own task status transitions.
- Scheduler decides closure/failure/blocking eligibility.
- `/execute` returns scoped implementation handoff; it does not close tasks.
- `/verify` gives functional verdict/evidence; in scheduler mode it does not close/fail/block/promote.
- `/red-verify` gives semantic verdict for per-task T3 checks and T2 feature-completion checks; in scheduler mode it does not close/fail/block/promote.
- Scheduler must write the closure/failure/blocking decision, final task status, and evidence links to the authoritative indexed `.memory-bank/tasks/TASK-*.task.json` record before `/mb-sync`.
- `/mb-sync` records/reconciles already-written task state. It does not decide closure/failure/blocking/promotion and must not sync a decision that exists only in scheduler context.
- T0/T1 scheduler closure may use compact evidence / functional PASS according to tier policy.
- T2 scheduler task closure requires full protocol, required packet/spec gates, and `VERDICT: PASS`; per-task `/red-verify` is not required for T2 task closure.
- T2 feature completion requires feature-level `/red-verify --feature FT-<ID>` with `SEMANTIC_VERDICT: semantic-pass` after all tasks for that feature are implemented.
- T3 scheduler task closure requires full protocol, required packet/spec gates, `VERDICT: PASS`, and per-task `SEMANTIC_VERDICT: semantic-pass` before scheduler marks `done`.
- T3 scheduler closure also requires exact markers `HUMAN_CHECKPOINT: done` and `ROLLBACK_RECOVERY_NOTE: present`.

Manual mode:
- Expected T0/T1 simple flow: `/execute -> /verify` for one TASK.
- Manual closure is allowed only when an explicit closure owner exists.
- `explicit standalone owner` means either the user directly asked the current top-level agent to close the task, or the top-level agent/orchestrator explicitly runs a manual workflow for one TASK and records that it owns closure. Subagents/worker prompts do not silently become closure owners.
- `/verify PASS` may mark `T0` / `T1` `status: done` only when explicit closure ownership is present and completed evidence has been written to the task record `verify` field and the compact/full protocol required by tier.
- If explicit closure owner is absent, `/verify` records `VERDICT: PASS`, evidence, and a closure recommendation, leaves `status` unchanged, and tells the scheduler/owner to close.
- `T2` manual task closure requires `/verify PASS` plus full protocol and required packet/spec gates; per-task `/red-verify` / `mb-red-verify` is optional, while T2 feature completion requires feature-level `/red-verify --feature FT-<ID>` `SEMANTIC_VERDICT: semantic-pass`.
- `T3` manual task closure requires `/verify PASS` plus per-task `/red-verify` / `mb-red-verify` `SEMANTIC_VERDICT: semantic-pass` before `status: done` or `/mb-sync`; if semantic-pass is absent, leave closure pending or blocked, not done.
- `semantic-concern` in manual mode means do not trust the existing `done` state without human review / follow-up.
- Do not mix scheduler mode and manual mode inside one task run.
- No persisted `mode` field is used.

## Inputs
- `TASK_ID`, for example `TASK-123`
- `.memory-bank/tasks/index.json`
- indexed `.memory-bank/tasks/<TASK_ID>.task.json`
- task `tier: T0|T1|T2|T3`
- feature or epic docs referenced by the task
- `.memory-bank/requirements.md` / REQ IDs when relevant
- `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md`, `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`, and all linked
  authoritative SDD specs when the task record or linked feature contains SDD
  spec links, for any tier
- richer task fields when present: `source_artifacts`, `normative_inputs`,
  `constraints`, `invariants`, `verification_targets`, `purpose`,
  `success_outcome`, `anti_goals`, `runtime_context`
- `.memory-bank/packets/<TASK_ID>.packet.json` when present or expected by
  tier/policy; `/prd-to-tasks` creates initial required packets and
  `/mb-doctor` validates readiness before execution handoff

Authoritative SDD spec links are links to `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`,
`.memory-bank/tech-specs/`, `.memory-bank/architecture/`,
`.memory-bank/contracts/`, `.memory-bank/domains/`, `.memory-bank/states/`,
`.memory-bank/adrs/`, `.memory-bank/testing/`, or `.memory-bank/runbooks/`.

Missing richer fields or absent SDD spec links do not block classic `T0` /
`T1` tasks; fall back to referenced docs.
For `T2` / `T3`, missing linked SDD specs are a blocker for serious work.

## Minimal Preflight
Stop with an explicit handoff error if:
- task record/indexed file is missing
- the record `id` does not match `TASK_ID`
- `tier` is missing or is not `T0|T1|T2|T3`
- task `status` is `blocked`, `failed`, or `done`
- any `depends_on` task is missing or is not `done`
- `tier` is `T2` / `T3` and neither task richer fields nor linked feature
  `spec_design_links` include relevant SDD spec links
- task, packet summary, feature, implementation plan, linked specs, or
  acceptance criteria are contradictory, underspecified for safe
  implementation, or logically inconsistent
- success cannot be verified from the provided acceptance criteria,
  verification targets, gates, or linked specs
- implementation would exceed assigned scope, touch forbidden scope, or require
  an unsettled product/spec/architecture/public-contract/state/data/security
  decision
- task appears materially broader than assigned, or its tier is obviously too
  low for the actual implementation risk

Do not block `T0` / `T1` only because SDD spec links are absent.
Route only by `task.tier`. Do not use legacy `risk` / `risk.level`.
Do not validate `packet_ref`, `source_task_hash`, packet freshness, or packet
status inside `mb-execute`. If packet context exists, treat it as derivative
context. If it contradicts the task record or linked specs in a way that affects
implementation semantics, stop with a blocker and report the contradiction.

## Protocol Routing
Create `.tasks/<TASK_ID>/` for runtime artifacts.

`T0` / `T1`: use compact protocol:
- `.protocols/<TASK_ID>/run.md`; record tier, goal, context, plan, changes,
  gates, evidence, Goal Interpretation, packet context when present, and
  handoff notes
- `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED` is a local evidence marker only, not task closure

`T2` / `T3`: use full protocol:
- `.protocols/<TASK_ID>/context.md`, `plan.md`, `progress.md`,
  `verification.md`, `handoff.md`

`T3`: exact marker lines are closure requirements:
- `HUMAN_CHECKPOINT: done`
- `ROLLBACK_RECOVERY_NOTE: present`

Record whether these markers are present or still needed; do not close the task.

## Implementation Rules
- Keep scope bounded to the task and its acceptance criteria.
- For any tier, if the task record or linked feature contains authoritative SDD
  spec links, read `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md`,
  `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`, and all linked authoritative SDD specs before
  editing; treat them as normative inputs.
- Record Goal Interpretation before broad edits:
  - Purpose
  - Success outcome
  - Anti-goals
  - Allowed write scope
  - Forbidden scope
  - Stop conditions
- Record constraints, touched areas, packet-sourced checks when used, and gates.
- Stay inside `runtime_context.allowed_write_scope` when present.
- Do not touch `runtime_context.forbidden_scope`; if it was touched, stop and
  record a blocker.
- If fan-out is needed, use narrow non-overlapping worker scopes.
- Preserve unrelated changes and do not rewrite generated `shared-*` files.
- Keep protocol notes factual: what changed, what was checked, where evidence is.

## Local Gates
Run relevant local gates from project instructions: lint/typecheck, unit tests,
and integration/e2e checks only when relevant.
When packet context is present, run applicable packet-sourced
`verification.commands` / `success_checks`, or record why each was skipped.

If a gate cannot run or fails, record command, result, evidence path, and the
blocker in the protocol/handoff. Do not convert that into final task status.

## Output / Handoff Contract
Finish with:
- changed files summary
- protocol file paths
- local gates run and results
- evidence paths under `.tasks/<TASK_ID>/`
- verification targets and risk notes for verifier/reviewer
- packet context used and packet-sourced checks run or skipped with reason
- scope compliance: yes/no
- forbidden scope touched: yes/no
- MB-SYNC handoff notes: what should be synchronized and by whom
- recommended next owner: scheduler, verifier, red-verifier, explicit standalone owner, or human

## Non-Ownership Rules
`mb-execute` never:
- closes tasks
- writes final task status
- runs `/mb-sync`
- runs `/verify` or `/red-verify`
- promotes, blocks, or unblocks dependents
- performs scheduler transitions such as in-progress, failed, or done

Schedulers (`/autopilot`, `/autonomous`) or an explicit standalone owner perform
verification orchestration, final status decisions, MB-SYNC, and dependent
promotion/blocking.
