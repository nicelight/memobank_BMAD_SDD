# Memory Bank structure templates

Use these templates to initialize a repo.

> Note: Templates are intentionally **short** and **structural**.
> The Memory Bank will be expanded by the agent based on PRD/codebase.

## 1) `AGENTS.md` (repo root)

Keep it ~100 lines. It must be a **map**, not an encyclopedia.

```markdown
# Agent Operating Guide (Project Map)

## Prime before work
1. Read `AGENTS.md` (this guide)
2. Read `.memory-bank/constitution.md` (top governing policy)
3. Read `.memory-bank/mbb/index.md` (Memory Bank rules)
4. Read `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md` (spec readiness/backbone state)
5. Read `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` (normative spec registry)
6. Read `.memory-bank/index.md` (table of contents)
7. If no explicit top-level role is given, use ROLE: GENERAL and read `.memory-bank/roles/general.md`.
8. If ROLE: ORCHESTRATOR, read `.memory-bank/roles/orchestrator.md`.
9. If delegated worker, read `.memory-bank/roles/worker.md`.
10. Read task/feature-specific docs

## Role Mode

If no explicit role is given to the top-level agent, act as:

ROLE: GENERAL

Delegated agents are not ORCHESTRATOR or GENERAL by default.
The role is fixed and cannot be changed.

Full role contracts live in:
- `.memory-bank/roles/orchestrator.md`
- `.memory-bank/roles/general.md`
- `.memory-bank/roles/worker.md`

## Preferred context routing
- Start with `.memory-bank/architecture/*` and `.memory-bank/guides/*` for concept priming.
- If present, prefer explicit normative docs such as `.memory-bank/constitution.md`, `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md`, `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`, `.memory-bank/invariants.md`, `.memory-bank/glossary.md`, `.memory-bank/contracts/boundary-map.md`, `.memory-bank/contracts/*`, `.memory-bank/states/*`, `.memory-bank/runbooks/*`, and `.memory-bank/testing/*`.
- Normative docs enrich the Memory Bank; they do not invalidate valid duo docs.
- Before serious work, read `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md`, `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`, and follow linked SDD specs.
- Do not create a new spec before checking existing specs through `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`.
- For any tier, if the task record or linked feature contains authoritative SDD
  spec links, read `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md`, `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`, and those linked specs before
  implementation or verification.
- For `T2` / `T3` tasks, linked SDD specs are normative inputs; missing linked specs are a blocker for serious work.

## Docs First
After finishing a meaningful unit of work:
1) Update `.memory-bank/` (WHY/WHERE + navigation)
2) Then commit code changes

## Runtime vs durable memory
- Durable knowledge base: `.memory-bank/`
- Operational artifacts: `.tasks/` (NOT part of Memory Bank)
- Long-running plans/logs: `.protocols/`

## Clean context (recommended)
- Route each `TASK-XXX` by `task.tier` and `.memory-bank/workflows/tier-policy.md`.
- Delegation and worker reports follow `.memory-bank/roles/orchestrator.md` and `.memory-bank/roles/worker.md`.
- T0/T1 may use compact `.protocols/TASK-XXX/run.md`; compact evidence can be enough.
- Scheduler mode: T2 requires full protocol state, required packet/spec gates, and `/verify` `VERDICT: PASS`; per-task `/red-verify` is not required for T2 task closure.
- Scheduler mode: T2 feature completion requires `/red-verify --feature FT-<ID>` with `SEMANTIC_VERDICT: semantic-pass` after all feature tasks are implemented.
- Scheduler mode: T3 requires full protocol state, required packet/spec gates, `/verify` `VERDICT: PASS`, and per-task `/red-verify` `SEMANTIC_VERDICT: semantic-pass` before the scheduler marks `done`.
- Scheduler mode: T3 also requires exact marker lines `HUMAN_CHECKPOINT: done` and `ROLLBACK_RECOVERY_NOTE: present`.
- Manual mode: T0/T1 may close after `/verify PASS` only with explicit closure ownership and completed evidence; T2 may close after `/verify PASS` when full protocol plus required packet/spec gates are satisfied; T3 must run per-task `/red-verify` before final closure/`/mb-sync`.
- Packet requirement: T2/T3 require canonical `.memory-bank/packets/TASK-<ID>.packet.json`; T0/T1 require packets only when `task.runtime_context.packet_required === true`.
- Required packets are derivative runtime artifacts under `.memory-bank/packets/`; `/prd-to-tasks` creates initial required packets and `/mb-doctor` validates readiness at the feature/task-queue boundary. Use `/mb-packet TASK-XXX` only to repair or refresh packets after task/spec changes.
- If running in **Claude Code**: execute each `TASK-XXX` in a **fresh Claude session** using tier-appropriate `.protocols/TASK-XXX/` state.
- If running in **Codex**: you can run each `TASK-XXX` in a fresh session via `codex exec` (see `/execute`).
- Sequencing: independent tasks may run in parallel clean sessions; dependent/shared-file tasks must run sequentially.

Codex (fresh session):
- `codex exec --ephemeral --full-auto -m gpt-5.2-high 'TASK_ID=TASK-123. Read AGENTS.md, .memory-bank/commands/execute.md, the indexed task record, .memory-bank/workflows/tier-policy.md, and packet context when present or expected. Assume packet readiness was checked by the feature/task-queue gate; do not repair or structurally validate packets here. Stop on semantic contradictions, unverifiable success, or scope/public-contract ambiguity. Use tier-appropriate .protocols/TASK-123/ state. Implement. Record evidence. Report → .tasks/TASK-123/…'`

Claude (fresh session):
- `claude -p --no-session-persistence --permission-mode acceptEdits --model opus 'TASK_ID=TASK-123. Read AGENTS.md, .memory-bank/commands/execute.md, the indexed task record, .memory-bank/workflows/tier-policy.md, and packet context when present or expected. Assume packet readiness was checked by the feature/task-queue gate; do not repair or structurally validate packets here. Stop on semantic contradictions, unverifiable success, or scope/public-contract ambiguity. Use tier-appropriate .protocols/TASK-123/ state. Implement. Record evidence. Report → .tasks/TASK-123/…'`

## Two modes (manual vs scheduler)
- **Manual**: run `/analysis` → `/brief` → `/constitution` if `project_principles` is not `ratified|partial` → `/write-prd` → `/spec-init` → `/prd` → `/spec-design` → `/prd-to-tasks FT-<NNN>` → `/mb-doctor` at the feature/task-queue boundary → execute tasks one-by-one with `/execute TASK-<ID>` → `/verify TASK-<ID>`; run per-task `/red-verify` for T3 tasks, optional for T2 tasks, and run `/red-verify --feature FT-<NNN>` before T2 feature completion; `/mb-sync` only when durable Memory Bank docs/state changed. `/prd-to-tasks` performs feature-level SDD design and creates required initial packets before task handoff. `/spec-design` is mandatory after `/prd`, but simple T0/T1 projects may record a minimal backbone with irrelevant areas `not_applicable`; it may also create one first foundation task when a minimum executable baseline is needed. Use `/brainstorm` before `/brief` only for raw ideas, use `/clarify-feature FT-<NNN>` only for explicit feature blockers, and use standalone `/spec-improve`/`/mb-packet` only for repair or refresh.
- **Autonomous (batch)**: use `/autonomous` for full `PRD → done`; it runs `/spec-auto --init`, mandatory `/spec-design --all`, and `/spec-auto --all`. Use `/autopilot` only if JSON task records and required SDD spec links already exist. See: `.memory-bank/workflows/execute-loop.md` and `.memory-bank/workflows/autonomy-policy.md`.

`.tasks/` naming:
- Folder per process: `.tasks/TASK-<ID>/`
- Files: `TASK-<ID>-S-<STAGE>-final-report-<code|docs>-<NN>.md`
- Keep each report to ≤ 3–5 files worth of analysis to avoid context overflow

## Quality gates (before merge)
- lint / typecheck / build
- unit tests
- e2e tests (if UI/flow)

## Memory Bank entry points
Command specs live in `skills/_shared/references/commands/*.md`.
`skills/_shared/scripts/init-mb.js` generates `.memory-bank/commands/*`, runtime proxy skills, and the current entrypoints in generated `AGENTS.md`.

Representative commands:
- `/analysis`
- `/brief`
- `/constitution`
- `/write-prd`
- `/spec-init`
- `/prd`
- `/spec-design`
- `/spec-improve`
- `/spec-auto`
- `/clarify-feature`
- `/prd-to-tasks`
- `/mb-packet`
- `/execute`
- `/verify`
- `/red-verify`
- `/autopilot`
- `/mb-doctor`

> Keep this file small. Deep docs live under `.memory-bank/`.
```

Create symlinks (or copies if symlink not supported):
- `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`
- `GEMINI.md` → `AGENTS.md` *(optional)*

### Native skills (proxy commands for all runtimes)

Create thin proxy skills so commands work natively across tools:

| Directory | Runtime |
|-----------|---------|
| `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Claude Code + OpenCode |
| `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Codex CLI + OpenCode |

> Note: `.codex/` is **not** a skills directory. It is used for Codex **project configuration** (e.g. `.codex/config.toml`).

Each `SKILL.md` follows this pattern:
```yaml
---
name: <command-name>
description: <what it does>
---

Read and follow the instructions in `.memory-bank/commands/<command-name>.md`
```

This keeps `.memory-bank/commands/` as SSOT while giving each runtime native integration:
- Claude Code: `/command-name` in autocomplete
- Codex CLI: `$command-name` or via `/skills` browser
- OpenCode: `/command-name` in TUI (reads both `.claude/` and `.agents/`)

The `init-mb.js` script creates both sets automatically.

# Memory Bank Bible (MBB)

## Constitution precedence
- [.memory-bank/constitution.md](../constitution.md) is the top governing policy for agent decisions.
- MBB, spec-index, spec-backbone, invariants, contracts, states, testing, and workflow docs refine the Constitution and MUST NOT contradict it.

## SSOT pyramid
- **Code**: WHAT/HOW — implementation truth.
- **Docstrings**: contracts + `@docs` pointers.
- **Memory Bank**: WHY/WHERE — boundaries, invariants, navigation.

## Hard rules
1. Every `.memory-bank/**/*.md` file MUST have frontmatter with `description:`.
2. If a folder has >3 docs, add an `index.md` router.
3. Use annotated links: `[.memory-bank/path](rel-path): короткое описание`.
4. Atomic docs: one concept per doc; keep ~≤500 lines.
5. Duo docs remain valid: `architecture/` (WHAT/WHY) + `guides/` (HOW), cross-link both ways for concepts that use the classic pair model.
6. C4 layering: L1 product → L2 epics → L3 features → L4 plans/tasks.
7. Docs First: update MB immediately after finishing a task.
8. Refactor MB every 5–10 updates (split, merge, archive).
9. Separate facts from interpretations: mark hypotheses explicitly ("предположительно", "требует проверки").
10. After merge/rebase conflicts: re-check MB consistency.
11. MB-SYNC after each wave/significant change (see `workflows/mb-sync.md`).
12. When present, `constitution.md`, `spec-backbone.md`, `spec-index.md`, `glossary.md`, `invariants.md`, `contracts/*`, `states/*`, `runbooks/*`, and `testing/*` act as an explicit normative layer and should be linked from relevant docs.

## Forbidden
- Copy-paste implementation details / pseudocode
- Duplicating configs (timeouts, constants) instead of linking to source
- Speculative claims without evidence from code/metrics/tests

## Allowed / encouraged
- Invariants (MUST/NEVER)
- Contracts at boundaries
- Decision rationale + pointers
- Runbooks and verification procedures

# SDD Spec Index

## Purpose
- Keep a concise registry of existing and planned SDD specs.
- Read this index before creating new specs or doing serious T2/T3 work.
- Keep readiness, open design questions, backbone status, and routing handoffs in [.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md](spec-backbone.md).
- Feature `spec_design_status` lives in feature frontmatter, not in this index.

## Spec Registry
| Spec | Type | Path | Status | Owner command | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project Constitution | governance | [.memory-bank/constitution.md](constitution.md) | active | /constitution | Top governing policy. |
| Invariants | invariants | [.memory-bank/invariants.md](invariants.md) | planned | /spec-init or /spec-design | Global MUST/NEVER rules when evidence exists. |
| Glossary | glossary | [.memory-bank/glossary.md](glossary.md) | planned | /spec-init or /spec-design | Shared vocabulary when needed. |
| Boundary Map | contract | [.memory-bank/contracts/boundary-map.md](contracts/boundary-map.md) | draft | /spec-init or /spec-design | Lightweight responsibility/scope notes for task boundaries. |
| Testing Index | testing | [.memory-bank/testing/index.md](testing/index.md) | planned | /prd or /spec-design | Verification strategy and quality gates. |

## Planned Specs
| Area | Expected path | Needed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| user_scenarios | .memory-bank/user-scenarios.md | /prd, /spec-design | Create only when scenario evidence exists or gaps must be explicit. |
| core_domain | .memory-bank/domains/core-domain.md | /prd, /spec-design | Create only when domain model affects decomposition or shared design. |
| boundary_hints | .memory-bank/contracts/boundary-map.md | /prd, /spec-design | Seeded lightweight template; fill only evidence-backed responsibility/scope notes, no endpoint/OpenAPI details. |
| lifecycle_hints | .memory-bank/states/lifecycle-map.md | /prd, /spec-design | Create only when lifecycles affect feature boundaries. |
| system_architecture | .memory-bank/architecture/system-architecture.md | /spec-design | Default global architecture hub after /prd. |
| feature_design | .memory-bank/tech-specs/FT-<NNN>-<slug>.md | /prd-to-tasks | Feature-local specs only when needed before task decomposition. |

## Broken / Missing Links
- TBD

## Update Rules
- Keep this file as index/registry only: names, paths, statuses, owners, scopes, and broken links.
- Do not add global backbone status, backbone matrices, feature status maps, long hard rules, or open design question dumps here.
- Use [.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md](spec-backbone.md) for pre-PRD readiness, decomposition inputs, global backbone status, matrix, and handoffs.
- Use linked specs or ADRs for detailed decisions, rationale, contracts, state transitions, schemas, invariants, and testing rules.

# Boundary Map

## Purpose
- Keep lightweight boundary notes that help agents avoid crossing ownership, responsibility, or write-scope lines during decomposition and task execution.
- Use this file as an existing contract/spec input when task records need `purpose`, `success_outcome`, `anti_goals`, `runtime_context.allowed_write_scope`, `runtime_context.forbidden_scope`, or `runtime_context.stop_conditions`.

## Boundary Notes
| Boundary | Purpose | Direction | Owner | Known Constraints | Questions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Runtime Context Hints
- Allowed write scope hints: TBD
- Forbidden scope hints: TBD
- Stop condition hints: TBD

## Update Rules
- Keep entries evidence-backed and short.
- Do not add endpoint lists, OpenAPI details, request/response schemas, auth policy, error-code design, or implementation pseudocode here.
- Do not create new task fields for boundaries; link this file through existing task fields such as `source_artifacts`, `normative_inputs`, `constraints`, `invariants`, or `verification_targets`, and copy executable scope into `runtime_context` when needed.

## 6b) Example task record template

The skeleton does not generate this file. `/prd-to-tasks FT-<NNN>` first completes feature-level SDD design, then creates real feature `.memory-bank/tasks/TASK-*.task.json` records when the feature is ready or marks design blocked and stops. Exception: `/spec-design` may create one first foundation task, preferably `TASK-000`, with `feature: "FOUNDATION"`, `wave: "W0"`, and `status: "ready"` when a minimum executable baseline is needed before business features.

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-001",

Optional (but recommended) plans folder:
- `.memory-bank/tasks/plans/` — IMPL plans like `IMPL-FT-XXX.md`

Optional runtime context rules:
- `purpose`, `success_outcome`, `anti_goals`, and `runtime_context` are optional; existing tasks without them remain valid.
- `T0` / `T1`: `runtime_context.packet_required` defaults to false when absent. A packet is required only when the task record says `runtime_context.packet_required === true`; `packet_ref` without that flag is advisory only.
- `T2` / `T3`: a packet is required by tier. Generated T2/T3 records should explicitly store `runtime_context.packet_required: true` and canonical `packet_ref`.
- Required `packet_ref` points to `.memory-bank/packets/<TASK_ID>.packet.json`; omit `packet_ref` for T0/T1 when `packet_required` is false/absent.
- `allowed_write_scope`, `forbidden_scope`, and `stop_conditions` are preflight/evidence contracts. They do not replace sandbox permissions or role write-scope instructions.

### 6c) `.memory-bank/packets/`

Execution packets are compact derivative runtime artifacts for one task run:

```text
.memory-bank/packets/TASK-XXX.packet.json
```

Packet semantics:
- The task record and linked SDD specs remain the source of truth.
- A packet compiles existing context for execution; it must not invent missing specs, requirements, or scope.
- `/prd-to-tasks` creates initial required packets while feature/task/spec context is loaded. `/mb-packet TASK-XXX` refreshes a packet after task/spec changes or a `/mb-doctor` readiness finding.
- If a packet contradicts the task record, feature, tier policy, or linked specs, repair the source or refresh/rebuild it with `/mb-packet TASK-XXX` before execution handoff.
- Packet-local statuses are only `ready`, `ready_with_gaps`, `blocked`, and `stale`; these are not task lifecycle statuses.
- Task lifecycle remains `planned|ready|in_progress|blocked|done|failed`.
- No new `.memory-bank/modules/`, `.memory-bank/graph/`, or `.memory-bank/verification/` layers are introduced for this flow.
- Verification continues to use task `verify`, `verification_targets`, `.memory-bank/testing/`, `.protocols/TASK-XXX/`, and `.tasks/TASK-XXX/`.

# Testing & Verification

## Quality gates
- lint / typecheck
- unit tests
- integration tests (if applicable)
- e2e tests for critical user flows

## UI verification
- Prefer Playwright / agent-browser / CDP for UI flows when available
- Store screenshots/videos/traces in `.tasks/TASK-XXX/`
- In Memory Bank keep only links + short conclusions

## Anti-cheat
- Don’t "green" failing tests by weakening assertions without approval.
- If a test reveals a bug: log it (and fix only with explicit scope).

## Artifacts
- Put screenshots/logs/videos in `.tasks/TASK-XXX/`
- In Memory Bank store only links + short conclusions
```
