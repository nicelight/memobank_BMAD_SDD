# /spec-design - Global SDD backbone gate

<objective>
Create or update the mandatory global architecture/design backbone after `/prd` has created the FT set and before `/spec-improve FT-<NNN>`, `/spec-auto --all`, or `/prd-to-tasks`.

The gate is mandatory by workflow, but adaptive by depth:
- simple T0/T1 projects create a minimal backbone and mark irrelevant areas `not_applicable`;
- projects with shared/T2/T3 concerns get staged architecture decisions and normal backbone specs;
- unresolved key decisions are recorded as blockers and downstream commands must stop.

`/spec-design` does not create TASK records, implementation plans, or feature-local tech specs, and it does not replace `/spec-improve`.
</objective>

<process>

## 0) Input and timing
Run after `/prd`.

Supported arguments:
- no argument: inspect all current features and update the global backbone
- `--all`: same as no argument; explicit for autonomous or batch flow

Required inputs:
- `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`
- `.memory-bank/requirements.md`
- `.memory-bank/epics/`
- `.memory-bank/features/`
- existing relevant specs under `.memory-bank/architecture/`, `.memory-bank/guides/`, `.memory-bank/domains/`, `.memory-bank/contracts/`, `.memory-bank/states/`, `.memory-bank/adrs/`, `.memory-bank/testing/`, and `.memory-bank/runbooks/`

Never skip the command. For small independent T0/T1-only scope, write the minimal backbone status and mark non-applicable areas instead of expanding architecture.

## 1) Backbone status gate
Update `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` with a clear global backbone status:
- `complete`: shared/global decisions are recorded and no blocker remains
- `minimal`: project is simple/T0-T1 oriented; unnecessary areas are explicitly `not_applicable`
- `blocked`: key architecture decisions are unresolved

If status is `blocked`, stop downstream work. Record:
- unresolved decision
- affected features/requirements
- why a conservative assumption would be unsafe
- next question or owner needed

## 2) Phase A - staged architecture decision interview
Do not use a long questionnaire. Ask one question at a time with 2-3 options, a preferred option, and a short rationale. After each answer, record a summary in `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` or the relevant ADR/spec.

Confirm or choose only decisions that affect the current PRD:
- monolith vs split services
- persistence strategy
- API style
- frontend/backend boundary
- event model
- schema strategy
- deployment assumptions
- testing gates

For simple/T0-T1 projects, prefer conservative defaults such as modular monolith, local/simple persistence, no event bus, no separate HTTP boundary, and minimal testing gates when supported by PRD evidence. Mark unrelated areas `not_applicable`.

In autonomous mode, do not ask questions. Record conservative assumptions only when they are reversible and safe; otherwise set backbone status `blocked`.

## 3) Phase B - write initial global specs
Write or update only relevant backbone artifacts:
- `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`
- `.memory-bank/architecture/system-architecture.md` with Mermaid C4/context/container/component, data flow, and sequence diagrams when useful
- `.memory-bank/architecture/source-of-truth.md`
- `.memory-bank/architecture/module-boundaries.md`
- `.memory-bank/domains/runtime-data-model.md`
- `.memory-bank/contracts/api-guidelines.md`
- `.memory-bank/contracts/http-api.md` or `.memory-bank/contracts/openapi.md` only when a separate HTTP boundary spec is needed
- `.memory-bank/contracts/agent-chat-bus.md` if agent/event/chat boundary exists
- `.memory-bank/contracts/message-envelope.md` if messages/events/envelopes exist
- `.memory-bank/guides/frontend-component-guide.md` if frontend component system/design behavior is in scope
- `.memory-bank/glossary.md`
- `.memory-bank/invariants.md`
- `.memory-bank/testing/*`
- `.memory-bank/adrs/*` for stable architecture decisions

Keep output conservative. Prefer updating an existing authoritative spec over creating a new one.

Do not create:
- `.memory-bank/tasks/*.task.json`
- `.memory-bank/tasks/plans/*`
- feature-local `.memory-bank/tech-specs/FT-*.md`
- implementation plans
- separate diagrams folders; diagrams belong as Mermaid sections in `.memory-bank/architecture/system-architecture.md`

## 4) OpenAPI policy
OpenAPI is not the source of truth for the whole system.

Rules:
- backend schemas such as FastAPI/Pydantic, or equivalent stack schemas, should generate OpenAPI when that stack exists or is selected
- `.memory-bank/contracts/api-guidelines.md` defines naming, status codes, error format, auth, CORS, upload, pagination, and compatibility rules
- OpenAPI covers only frontend/backend HTTP API
- agent/domain/event/state/safety contracts live in separate specs
- do not write a large hand-written `openapi.yaml` before architecture design
- gate: generated OpenAPI validates and critical endpoints have integration/contract tests

## 5) Phase C - targeted follow-up interviews
While writing boundary/data/testing specs, ask follow-up questions only for unresolved branch decisions that block truthful specs.

Examples:
- the data model needs retention or migration rules not present in PRD
- HTTP API exists but auth/error/upload behavior is undecided
- event/message boundary exists but envelope or ordering rules are undecided
- frontend component behavior is normative but ownership/design system source is unclear

If the answer is unavailable and a safe assumption is not possible, mark backbone status `blocked` and stop.

## 6) Update routing
Update `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`:
- source-of-truth hierarchy
- global backbone status and blockers
- baseline backbone specs and their scope
- authoritative/planned/candidate/unknown/not_applicable areas
- feature-to-backbone routing
- expected spec locations

For affected feature docs:
- add SDD Design Gate notes with normative backbone links where evidence exists
- do not set `spec_design_status: complete` unless feature-local `/spec-improve` criteria are already fully satisfied
- do not mark `not_required` for features that still depend on shared T2/T3 backbone decisions

## 7) Handoff
Report:
- backbone status: `complete`, `minimal`, or `blocked`
- specs created/updated
- not_applicable areas and rationale for simple projects
- affected features and normative links
- blockers/open questions
- next command: `/spec-improve FT-<NNN>` for manual flow, or `/spec-auto --all` before `/prd-to-tasks --all` in autonomous flow

</process>
