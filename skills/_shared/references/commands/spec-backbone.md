# /spec-backbone - Shared SDD backbone

<objective>
Identify and document shared or cross-feature design backbone after `/prd` has created the full FT set and before `/spec-design FT-<NNN>`, `/spec-auto --all`, or `/prd-to-tasks`.

Backbone areas include domains/data models, contracts/APIs/events, state/lifecycle, architecture boundaries, ADRs, security/compliance, persistence/migrations, runtime/runbooks, and testing strategy.

`/spec-backbone` does not create TASK records, implementation plans, or feature-local designs, and it does not replace `/spec-design`.
</objective>

<process>

## 0) Input and timing
Run after `/prd`.

Supported arguments:
- no argument: inspect all current features and update only evident shared backbone
- `--all`: same as no argument; explicit for autonomous or batch flow

Skip when all targeted features are small independent T0/T1-only work with no shared design area.

Run or recommend this command when:
- multiple FT share domain, contract, state, API, security, data, runtime, migration, or testing concerns
- any likely T2/T3 shared work exists
- duplicate per-feature specs are likely without a shared backbone pass

## 1) Evidence gate
Read:
- `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`
- `.memory-bank/requirements.md`
- `.memory-bank/epics/`
- `.memory-bank/features/`
- existing relevant specs under `.memory-bank/architecture/`, `.memory-bank/domains/`, `.memory-bank/contracts/`, `.memory-bank/states/`, `.memory-bank/adrs/`, `.memory-bank/testing/`, and `.memory-bank/runbooks/`

Only write evidence-backed authoritative specs. Do not invent decisions.

Unknown, planned, candidate, conflicting, or missing decisions go to `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` as gaps, blockers, or open questions.

## 2) Backbone scan
Identify shared/cross-feature concerns:
- domains and data ownership
- contracts, APIs, schemas, events, and integration boundaries
- state machines, lifecycle, and failure states
- architecture boundaries and module ownership
- ADR-worthy decisions
- security, privacy, compliance, auth, secrets, payments, or abuse controls
- persistence, migrations, retention, data loss, and rollback
- runtime, operations, runbooks, observability, and deploy impact
- testing strategy and verification targets

Prefer updating an existing authoritative spec over creating a new one.

## 3) Write only shared backbone artifacts
Allowed outputs:
- `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`
- `.memory-bank/architecture/<topic>.md`
- `.memory-bank/domains/<domain>.md`
- `.memory-bank/contracts/<boundary>.md`
- `.memory-bank/states/<lifecycle>.md`
- `.memory-bank/adrs/ADR-<NNN>-<slug>.md`
- `.memory-bank/testing/<topic>.md`
- `.memory-bank/runbooks/<topic>.md`
- affected `.memory-bank/features/FT-*.md` with SDD Design Gate notes and normative links where evidence exists

Do not create:
- `.memory-bank/tasks/*.task.json`
- `.memory-bank/tasks/plans/*`
- feature-local `.memory-bank/tech-specs/FT-*.md`
- implementation plans

## 4) Update routing
Update `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`:
- mark authoritative backbone specs and their feature/REQ scope
- mark planned/candidate/unknown/not_applicable areas honestly
- record blockers/open questions for missing decisions
- avoid duplicate per-feature specs for shared concerns

For affected feature docs:
- add or update SDD Design Gate notes with normative backbone links where evidence exists
- do not set `spec_design_status: complete` unless the feature-local `/spec-design` criteria are already fully satisfied
- do not mark `not_required` for features that still depend on shared T2/T3 backbone decisions

## 5) Handoff
Report:
- whether the pass ran or was skipped
- shared backbone specs created/updated
- affected features and normative links
- blockers/open questions
- next command: `/spec-design FT-<NNN>` for manual flow, or `/spec-auto --all` before `/prd-to-tasks --all` in autonomous flow
