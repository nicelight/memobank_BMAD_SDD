# /brief - Product Brief input contract

<objective>
Create or update `.memory-bank/analysis/product-brief.md` as a concise Product Brief before `/write-prd`, with `/constitution` as the normal next step only when project principles are not already `ratified|partial`.

Product Brief is the input contract for `/constitution` when needed and for `/write-prd`. It is not a PRD, backlog, marketing document, research report, or task plan.
</objective>

<process>

## 0) Scope
Use `/brief` when the concept is clear enough to summarize, or after `/brainstorm`.

Allowed outputs:
- `.memory-bank/analysis/index.md`
- `.memory-bank/analysis/product-brief.md`

Do not create:
- feature docs
- task records
- implementation plans
- research reports
- PRFAQ
- `.memory-bank/analysis/assumptions.md`
- command aliases

## 1) Inputs
Read, when present:
- latest relevant `.memory-bank/analysis/brainstorming/BR-*.md`
- existing `.memory-bank/analysis/product-brief.md`
- user-provided concept, notes, or PRD-like text

If brainstorming exists, include it in `Source artifacts`. If no brainstorming exists, a brief may still be created directly from user input.

## 2) Create or update Product Brief
Create `.memory-bank/analysis/product-brief.md` with a concise 1-2 page target.

When creating `.memory-bank/analysis/index.md`, include:

```yaml
---
description: Analysis artifact index.
status: active
---
```

Required structure:

```md
---
description: Product Brief input contract for PRD.
status: draft
type: product-brief
---
# Product Brief

## Metadata
- Status: draft

```

The Product Brief frontmatter is required. `type` must be `product-brief`, and `status` should match the current brief state, starting as `draft`.

KISS decision values:
- `proceed`
- `blocked`

Do not add `no-go`.

## 3) Decision rules
Set `Decision: proceed` only when the brief is clear enough for `/constitution` if needed and `/write-prd`.

Set `Decision: blocked` when open questions block PRD quality. If blocked:
- do not continue to `/prd` unless the user explicitly overrides
- explain the blocking open questions

If the user explicitly overrides a blocked brief, `/write-prd` may continue, but Constitution conflicts and PRD-level blockers still stop downstream decomposition.

## 4) Downstream path
The next planning chain is:

```text
/brief -> /constitution if project_principles is not ratified|partial -> /write-prd -> /spec-init -> /prd -> /spec-design -> /spec-improve FT-<NNN> -> /prd-to-tasks FT-<NNN>
```

Check `.memory-bank/constitution.md` before recommending the next command. If `project_principles: ratified|partial`, continue directly to `/write-prd`. If `project_principles: framework-default|skipped|missing`, recommend `/constitution`; it should read `.memory-bank/analysis/product-brief.md` and run the governing-principles interview before `/write-prd`. If the user explicitly skips `/constitution`, continue to `/write-prd` with framework-default/skipped principles and recommend revisiting `/constitution` later.

Do not recommend `/prd-to-tasks` directly from `/brief`.
Recommend `/clarify-feature FT-<NNN>` only when a specific feature is explicitly pending/blocked or has decomposition-affecting unresolved markers.

## 5) Update index and finish
Update `.memory-bank/analysis/index.md` with:
- product brief status
- source artifacts
- decision
- recommended next step

Recommended next step:
- if `Decision: proceed` and `project_principles: ratified|partial`: `/write-prd`, then `/spec-init`, `/prd`, `/spec-design`, `/spec-improve FT-<NNN>`, and `/prd-to-tasks FT-<NNN>`
- if `Decision: proceed` and `project_principles: framework-default|skipped|missing`: `/constitution`, then `/write-prd`, `/spec-init`, `/prd`, `/spec-design`, `/spec-improve FT-<NNN>`, and `/prd-to-tasks FT-<NNN>`
- if `Decision: blocked`: answer blocking questions, then rerun `/brief`
