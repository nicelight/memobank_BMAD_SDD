# /spec-init - SDD Design Specs Index bootstrap

<objective>
Create or update `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` as the SDD Design Specs Index / route map after a clarified `/write-prd` and before `/prd`.

`/spec-init` identifies design areas, expected spec locations, gaps, and open questions. It does not create authoritative architecture, contracts, states, data, or domain specs by default.
</objective>

<process>

## 0) Position in workflow
Run after clarified `/write-prd` and before `/prd`.

Canonical manual chain:
`/analysis -> /brief -> /constitution -> /write-prd -> /spec-init -> /prd -> /spec-design FT-001 -> /prd-to-tasks FT-001`.

## 1) Inputs
Read, if present:
- `.memory-bank/constitution.md`
- `.memory-bank/analysis/product-brief.md`
- `.memory-bank/prd.md`
- existing `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`
- existing specs under `.memory-bank/architecture/`, `.memory-bank/tech-specs/`, `.memory-bank/contracts/`, `.memory-bank/domains/`, `.memory-bank/states/`, `.memory-bank/adrs/`, `.memory-bank/testing/`, and `.memory-bank/runbooks/`

Stop if `.memory-bank/prd.md` is missing or not clarified enough for `/prd`.

## 2) Interview gate
Ask questions only when the resulting skeleton/index would otherwise mislead downstream agents.

Rules:
- maximum 5 questions per pass
- use the same style as `/write-prd`: one targeted question with recommended options and short rationale
- ask only about design routing decisions needed before `/prd`
- do not use the interview to force full architecture design early

If the user cannot answer, record the gap as `unknown` or an open question instead of inventing a spec.

## 3) Update spec-index.md
Strengthen `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` into an SDD Design Specs Index with these sections:
- Purpose and hard rules
- Existing authoritative specs
- Planned design areas
- Candidate design areas
- Unknown design areas
- Not applicable areas
- Feature design status map
- Expected spec locations
- Gaps and open questions
- Update rules

Use simple links and short annotations. Keep it a route map, not a design dump.

Design area status meanings:
- `authoritative`: the linked spec is evidence-backed and binding
- `planned`: likely needed, but decision/spec is not written yet
- `candidate`: may be needed; confirm during `/spec-design`
- `unknown`: insufficient evidence
- `not_applicable`: explicitly out of scope

Expected locations:
- feature hubs: `.memory-bank/tech-specs/FT-<NNN>-<slug>.md`
- architecture notes: `.memory-bank/architecture/<topic>.md`
- contracts: `.memory-bank/contracts/<boundary>.md`
- domain/data models: `.memory-bank/domains/<domain>.md`
- states: `.memory-bank/states/<lifecycle>.md`
- ADRs: `.memory-bank/adrs/ADR-<NNN>-<slug>.md`
- testing/runbooks: `.memory-bank/testing/` and `.memory-bank/runbooks/`

## 4) Hard rule
MUST NOT create authoritative design specs unless PRD/user evidence explicitly contains the decision.

Allowed from `/spec-init`:
- create/update `.memory-bank/spec-index.md`
- add planned/candidate/unknown/not_applicable route entries
- record gaps/open questions

Not allowed by default:
- inventing architecture
- inventing contracts
- inventing state machines
- inventing data models
- creating ADRs for decisions not made

## 5) Handoff
Report:
- spec-index path
- planned/candidate/unknown/not_applicable areas
- blocking gaps, if any
- expected next command: `/prd`
